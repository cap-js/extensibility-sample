# Business Logic Extensibility for CAP using the CDS-Oyster Code Sandbox

Welcome to the Extensibility Hands-On Workshop at re>â‰¡CAP 2025.

## Overview

**Description** - In this workshop, you'll learn how to implement business logic extensions using [CDS-Oyster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-oyster) for [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap).

We will explore the CDS-Oyster plugin and how it enables customers to write and deploy untrusted code to a multi-tenant SaaS application.
Key concepts include creating bound and unbound actions, implement CRUD event handlers and testing and debugging them locally.

If you want to learn more in depth about CAP Extension capabilities, you can switch to the branch `reCAP2024` of this same repository, where you will find a workshop on the overall extensibility concept of CAP.
