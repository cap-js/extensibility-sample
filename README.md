# Business Logic Extensibility for CAP Using the CDS-Oyster Code Sandbox

Welcome to the Extensibility Hands-On Workshop at re>≡CAP 2025.

## Overview

**Description** – In this workshop, you'll learn how to implement business logic extensions using [CDS-Oyster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sap/cds-oyster) with the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap).

We’ll explore how the CDS-Oyster plugin enables customers to safely write and deploy untrusted code in a multi-tenant SaaS application.  
Key topics include implementing bound and unbound actions, handling CRUD events, and testing and debugging extensions locally.

If you're interested in a deeper dive into CAP extensibility concepts, check out the `reCAP2024` branch of this repository, which includes a more comprehensive workshop on the overall extensibility model in CAP.
